# Contributing

My main goal of Quanty is to create a bot that can make discord's moderators and members lives better. Please read below on how you can take in this.

## **Guide**

```
1. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)

2. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)

3. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)

4. Open a Pull Request
```

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

For now, please feel free to read the **To-Do List** below and contribute to whatever ideas I have there. Please also feel free to submit your own ideas.

## **To-Do List**
